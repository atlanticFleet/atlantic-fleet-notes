# Notes

The meeting started extremely late, so we only got a chance to go over the announcement items. We also briefly tested out the text to speech bot service, which worked great. warelock changed the TTS bot activation prefix from "/tts" to "/say", to avoid conflict with the Discord built-in "/tts" command which doesn't work anyway.
